### My Journey
Hi all, my name is Robbin Pelgrim, and I'm a self-taught software developer with a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development. My career journey started with a passion for digital marketing, which gave me a unique perspective on the importance of delivering business-focused solutions. Over the past two years, I've shifted my focus to crafting software that drives meaningful business impact through automation and smart solutions.

I believe in the power of learning through doing, and I challenge myself to constantly grow by tackling new problems and exploring innovative technologies. This blog serves as a personal knowledge repository where I document the insights, lessons, and techniques I've gained along the way. My goal is to create a resource not only for myself but also for fellow developers who may encounter similar challenges in their journeys.

Whether you're here to learn, get inspired, or simply explore, I hope my experiences can help spark ideas and solutions in your own work. Let's build and grow together!
