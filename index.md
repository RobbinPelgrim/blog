### My Journey
Hi all, my name is Robbin Pelgrim and im a software developer focussing on front-end and back-end challenges with a central core value: Creating quick business impact through automation and smart solutions. I always strive to challenge myself and learn new things so in this blog I will write articles and guides of new info I have gathered and implemented, for myself to look back on, and maybe help other developers with similar challenges.
